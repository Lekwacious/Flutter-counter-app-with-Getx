# getx_intro_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started With GetX package

 I reimplemented the Flutter counter app with the Getx package.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Getx package documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/get)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
For help getting started with Flutter, view the 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
